This is a simple adaptation of the [default PureCSS theme](http://yui.github.io/skinbuilder/?mode=pure) to work with [dgrid](http://dgrid.io/) and [dojox/charting](http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.9/charting/). The purpose is to show a quick demo for creating a custom there for dgrid and a chart.

# Installation

You'll either need to setup the following dependencies:

* dojo
* dijit
* dojox/charting
* dgrid
* put-selector
* xstyle
* stylus (optionally, if you want to use the preprocessed CSS)

Or you could try out the [generator-dojo](https://github.com/bryanforbes/generator-dojo/) Grunt task

Then, put the pure directory parallel to /dojo in your tree, and simply try out the example.html.
